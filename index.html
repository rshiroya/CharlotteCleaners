        <p> A Quick Way to do Laundry</p>
        <div class = "section">

            <p>
                Everyone has to do laundry, but not everyone knows how to do it properly. It can be perplexing and frustrating at first,
                and most people do not appreciate it, but it must be completed.

            </p>

        <div class = "section">
            <img src = "Laundry%20Symbols.jpg" alt="symbols" class = "pictures" >
            <p>To begin with, we start by reading labels, it will give us the what treatment to use on the specific fabric.
                Labels signify whether or not clothes should be cleaned,
                as well as how they should be washed. The international clothing symbols provide all of the information required to properly wash each piece.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "section">
            <img src = "segregation.png" alt = "segregation" class = "pictures" >
            <p>
                The next step is segregation of the clothes. Separate loads of clothes are made on the basis of color shades, weight of the cloth,
                and material. We follow strict guidelines on washing dark, light and white colors, as it prevents fromm getting color stains.
                Heavy clothes like woolen sweaters are given separate cold wash.
            </p>

        <div class = "section">
            <img src ="dryer.png" alt = "dryer"  class = "pictures">
            <p>
                Followed by selecting appropriate detergent and fabric softener. Detergent and softener packaging tell us what amount should we use for each load.
                Fourth step is drying the clothes. After the wash cycles are over, shake them out to dry it easier.Then place it in dryer and add some
                dryer sheets to protect fabric and have a nice smell on your clothes.
